# Estimating contact network properties with kernel-ABC

This repository contains the master's thesis project of Rosemary McCloskey. I am
a student in the CIHR Strategic Training Program in Bioinformatics at the
Univeristy of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. My supervisor is Dr. Art
Poon, a scientist at the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, and an adjunct
professor in the Department of Medicine, Univerisity of British Columbia.

# Project organization

This project is divided into several folders, described below. Each of them
contains a README with further details.

## dependencies

The programs and simulations in this project have quite a few external
dependencies. To make this easier to manage, this folder contains a script to
download and compile all the necessary programs and libraries. It has been
tested on a couple of Linux systems. Realistically, it's not going to work on
every system out of the box, but it should at least give you an idea of what to
install.

## doc

Presentations, papers, etc.

## programs

Source code I have written for the project.

## reading

Papers I've read, and some notes about them. This isn't every paper I've read
for this project, because realistically I often get lazy and don't bother
writing notes. A lot of the notes are very sparse too, only a bullet point or
two.

## reference

Reference manuals for software. I like having offline documentation. There is a
Makefile which will download the most recent verison of everything.

## simulations

This is the biggest section. Contains all the computational experiments.
