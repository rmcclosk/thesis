      ``Particles'' are sampled from prior distributions on model parameters.
      Simulated trees are generated for each particle and compared to the
      observed tree with a phylogenetic kernel~\autocite{poon2013mapping}.
      Particles whose simulated trees are distant from the observed tree are
      removed. Surviving particles are perturbed, and new simulated datasets
      are generated. Iteration leads to an approximation of the posterior
      distribution on the model parameters.

    \begin{multicols}{3}
      We developed a kernel-ABC method for inference of structural contact
      network parameters from viral sequence data. The method is applicable to
      any network model from which networks can be simulated. We demonstrated
      that two of the parameters of the Barab\'asi-Albert preferential
      attachment model can be estimated with kernel-ABC. When applied to real
      data, we observed heterogeneity among model parameters, although
      estimated values of $\alpha$ were consistent with those observed in real
      social networks. 
    
      Due to the simple nature of the Barab\'asi-Albert model, it is likely
      misspecified for the real data we analyzed, and therefore caution must be
      exercised in interpreting the estimated values. However, the possibility
      to investigate more realistic models in the future makes our approach a
      useful tool for phylodynamic research on contact networks.
