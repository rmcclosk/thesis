  \caption{
    Reproduction of Figure 1A from Leventhal \textit{et al.} (2012) used to
    check the accuracy of our implementation of Gillespie simulation.
    Transmission trees were simulated over three types of network, with
    pathogen transmissibility varying from 0 to 1. Sackin's index was
    calculated for each simulated transmission tree.

  \caption{Approximation of mixture of Gaussians used by
    Del Moral \textit{et al.} (2012) and Sisson \textit{et al.} (2009) to test
    SMC. Solid black line indicates true distribution. Grey shaded area shows
    SMC approximation obtained with our implementation, using 10000
    particles with one simulated data point per particle.

  \caption{
    Cross-validation accuracy of kernel-SVM classifiers for $\alpha$ parameter
    of BA network model, for various tree kernel meta-parameters and
    epidemic scenarios. Each point was calculated based on 300 simulated
    transmission trees over networks with $\alpha$ = 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5. Dotted
    and and dashed lines indicate, respectively, performance of SVM using the
    nLTT statistic, and linear regression using Sackin's index. Facets
    are number of infected nodes before the simulation was stopped ($I$) and
    number of tips in the sampled transmission tree.

  \caption{Cross-validation accuracy of kernel-SVM classifiers for $m$
      parameter of BA network model, for various tree kernel
