Phylogenetic clustering with a Markov-modulated Poisson process

Most of the information that public health agencies and researchers have
about emerging disease epidemics is obtained by "gumshoe epidemiology",
that is, by asking infected people about where they went and who they
contacted. _Phylodynamics_ is an emerging area of research which aims to
enrich this information using viral genomic data and bioinformatic
methods. One application of phylodynamics is the identification of
groups of epidemiologically related individuals, termed phylogenetic
clustering. Here, we develop a novel clustering method which uses a
Markov-modulated Poisson process, applied to a "family tree" of viruses,
to identify parts of the population experiencing elevated transmission
rates. We applied this method to viral genomic data sampled from almost
8000 HIV-infected individuals in British Columbia.
