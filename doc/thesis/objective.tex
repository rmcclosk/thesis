Our objective is to develop a method to estimate structural parameters of the
contact network underlying an observed transmission tree.

\subsection{Prior work}

The present study is closely related to three groups of work with distinct
objectives, which will be reviewed in detail below.

%third group consists of studies which infer a structural network parameter from
%observed infection and recovery times, using Bayesian methods. These are most
%similar in aims to our work, but they rely on epidemiological observations
%rather than evolutionary information from phylogenies.

The first and largest group of related studies are phylodynamic investigations
of epidemiological parameters such as transmission rate, recovery rate, and
basic reproductive number~\autocite{pybus2009evolutionary, volz2013viral}. Like
our work, these studies make inferences about epidemiological processes from
the genetic diversity of virus populations, which is usually represented in the
form of a phylogeny. The majority of these employ a Bayesian \gls{MCMC}
approach to infer parameters of an epidemiological model whose likelihood can
be calculated, most often some variation of the
birth-death~\autocite{kendall1948generalized} or
coalescent~\autocite{kingman1982coalescent} models. Stadler
\etal~\autocite{stadler2011estimating} develop a formula for the likelihood of
a phylogeny with heterochronous tips under the birth-death model, which has
been used to estimate the basic reproductive number of several viral
epidemics~\autocite{stadler2011estimating}. However, the birth-death model is
cannot tell us anything about population structure, as it assumes that every
individual becomes infected at the same rate. Volz~\autocite{volz2012complex}
writes down the likelihood of a heterochronous phylogeny under a coalescent
model with arbitrarily complex population dynamics. This opens the door to more
complex inferences about population structure, as the population can be
partitioned into compartments with different transmission and recovery rates,
but still assumes that each compartment is homogeneously mixed. In other words,
the coalescent model can tell us about the \emph{global} structure of a
population, such as whether there exists a high-risk subgroup, but not about
the \emph{local} structure, such as the average number of contacts each
individual has. 

A second, more recent group of studies has evaluated the effect of network
structure on transmission tree shape. The use of models which assume a
\defn{panmictic} (that is, homogeneously mixed) population in phylodynamics has
become widespread, so it is natural that some researchers have investigated the
effects of this assumption. In particular, since phylodynamic methods use
phylogenies as their data source, several studies have examined the shapes of
phylogenies arising from non-panmictic populations. 
\citeauthor{o2010contact}~(\citeyear{o2010contact}) simulated epidemics over
networks with four types of degree distribution. They then estimated the
Bayesian skyride~\autocite{minin2008smooth} population size trajectory in two
ways: from the phylogeny, using \gls{MCMC}; and from the incidence and
prevalence trajectories, using the method developed by Volz
\etal~\autocite{volz2009phylodynamics}. They found that the concordance between
the two skyrides, as well as the relationship between the skyride and
prevalence curve, was qualitatively different for each degree distribution.
\citeauthor{leventhal2012inferring} simulated transmission trees over \gls{ER},
\gls{WS}, \gls{BA}, and full networks with fixed number of nodes and mean
degree. They calculated Sackin's index of the simulated trees while varying the
epidemic, network, and sampling parameters, and found that the relationship
between these parameters and Sackin's index varies considerably among the
different network models. In summary, studies in this group have demonstrated
that network structure profoundly influences tree shape, but have not attempted
to quantitatively infer network parameters from observed trees.

Finally, a third group of studies has used Bayesian methods to infer a
structural network parameter from observed infection and recovery times. This
third group is most similar in aims to our own work; rather than using
epidemiological observations, we employ viral phylogenies. The pioneering study
in this group was by
\citeauthor{britton2002bayesian}~(\citeyear{britton2002bayesian}), who
developed a Bayesian method to infer the $p$ parameter of an \gls{ER} network,
along with the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ parameters of \gls{SI} model. Their method
is able to use either infection and removal times, or removal times only.
However, it is designed for only a small number of observations (15 and 42
cases in their applications), and their estimates of $p$ for real outbreaks
were mostly uninformative (95\% confidence intervals [0.11-0.96] and
0.055-0.96]; $p$ is bounded in [0, 1]).
\citeauthor{groendyke2011bayesian}~(\citeyear{groendyke2011bayesian})
significantly updated and extended the methodology of
\citeauthor{britton2002bayesian}, and applied it to a measles outbreak
affecting 188 individuals. They were able to obtain a much more informative
estimate of $p$, although this data set included both symptom onset and
recovery times for all individuals. They also assumed that the entire network
was infected, so that the network size was exactly 188. It is unclear how well
their method would scale to networks with thousands of nodes.
