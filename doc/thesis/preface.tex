This work was conducted at the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS under the
supervision of Dr. Art Poon. I wrote the code, performed the experiments, and
wrote the thesis. Dr. Richard Liang assisted with the development of the
Gillespie simulation algorithm.

A version of chapters 2 and 3 has been submitted for publication in Molecular
Biology and Evolution, with the title ``Phylogenetic estimation of contact
network parameters with kernel-ABC''. A presentation with the same title was
given at the 23rd HIV Dynamics and Evolution meeting on April 25, in Woods
Hole, Massachussets, USA.
