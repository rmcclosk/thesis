The initial idea to use kernel approximate Bayesian computation to infer
contact network model parameters was Dr. Poon's. The tree kernel was originally
developed by Dr. Poon, but the version used here was implemented by me to
improve computational efficiency. The idea to apply sequential Monte Carlo is
credited to Dr. Alexandre Bouchard-C\^ot\'e. Dr. Sarah Otto suggested the
experiments involving a network with a heterogeneous $\alpha$ parameter and
peer-driven sampling. Dr. Richard H. Liang provided guidance in the development
of the Gillespie simulation algorithm. The \software{netabc} program, and all
supplementary analysis programs, were written by me.

A version of chapter 2 has been submitted for publication in Virus Evolution
with the title ``Reconstructing network parameters from viral phylogenies.'' A
presentation entitled ``Phylodynamic inference of contact network parameters
with kernel-ABC'' was given based on chapter 2 at the 23rd HIV Dynamics and
Evolution meeting on April 25, in Woods Hole, Massachussets, USA.
