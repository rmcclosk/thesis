\subsection{Analysis of \acrlong{BA} model}



\subsubsection*{Classifiers for BA model parameters based on tree shape}



Trees simulated under different values of \gls{alpha} were visibly quite
distinct (\cref{fig:alphatrees}). In particular, higher values of \gls{alpha}
produce networks with a small number of highly connected nodes which, once
infected, are likely to transmit to many other nodes. This results in a more
unbalanced, ladder-like structure in the phylogeny, compared to networks with
lower \gls{alpha} values. None of the other three parameters produced trees
which were as easily distinguished from each other
(\cref{fig:Itrees,fig:mtrees,fig:Ntrees,fig:Itrees}).  Sackin's index, which
measures tree imbalance, was significantly correlated with all four parameters
    (for $\alpha$, $I$, $m$, and $N$ respectively: Spearman's rho =
     0.85,
     \ensuremath{-0.12},
     \ensuremath{-0.13},
     0.09;
     $p$-values
     ${<}10^{-5}$,
     $0.003$,
     ${<}10^{-5}$,
     ${<}10^{-5}$).
The ratio of internal to terminal branch lengths was negatively correlated with
\gls{alpha} and \gls{I}, and positively correlated with \gls{m} and \gls{N}
  (Spearman's rho
    \ensuremath{-0.84},
    \ensuremath{-0.69},
    0.1,
    0.18;
  all $p < 10^{-5}$).

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \caption[Simulated transmission trees under three different values of BA parameter $\alpha$]{
    Simulated transmission trees under three different values of BA parameter
    $\alpha$. Epidemics were simulated on \gls{BA} networks of 5000 nodes, with
    \gls{alpha} equal to 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5, until 1000 individuals were
    infected. Transmission trees were created by sampling 500 infected nodes.
    Higher \gls{alpha} values produced networks with a small number of
    highly-connected nodes, resulting in highly unbalanced, ladder-like trees.
  }
  \label{fig:alphatrees}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:kpca} shows \gls{kPCA} projections of the simulated trees onto the
first two principal components of the kernel matrix. The figure shows only the
simulations with 500-tip trees and 1000 infected nodes. The three \gls{alpha}
and \gls{I} values considered are well separated from each other in feature
space. On the other hand, the three \gls{N} values overlap significantly, and
the three \gls{m} values are virtually indistinguishable. Similar observations
can be made for other values of \gls{I} and the number of tips
(\cref{fig:alphakpca,fig:Nkpca,fig:Ikpca,fig:mkpca}). The values of \gls{I} and
\gls{N} separated more clearly with larger numbers of tips, and in the case of
\gls{N}, larger epidemic sizes.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{kernel-kpca.pdf}
  \caption[Kernel-PCA projections of simulated trees under varying BA
           parameter values.]{
    Each parameter of the \gls{BA} model was individually varied to produce 300
    simulated trees. Kernel matrices were formed from all pairwise kernel
    scores among each set of 300 trees. The trees were projected onto the first
    two principal components of the kernel matrix calculated using \gls{kPCA}.
    All trees had 500 tips. The parameters not being varied were set to
    \gls{alpha} = 1, \gls{I} = 1000, \gls{m} = 2, and \gls{N} = 5000. The tree
    kernel meta-parameters were $\lambda = 0.3$ and $\sigma = 4$.
  }
  \label{fig:kpca}
\end{figure}



Accuracy of the \gls{kSVR} classifiers varied based on the parameter being
tested (\cref{fig:rsquared}, left). Classifiers based on two other tree
statistics, the \gls{nltt} and Sackin's index, generally exhibited worse
performance than the tree kernel, although the magnitude of the disparity
varied between the parameters (\cref{fig:rsquared}, centre and right). The
results were largely robust to variations in the tree kernel meta-parameters
$\lambda$ and $\sigma$, although accuracy varied between different epidemic and
sampling scenarios
(\cref{fig:alphacrossv,fig:mcrossv,fig:Icrossv,fig:Ncrossv}).

When classifying $\alpha$, the \gls{kSVR} classifier had an average $R^2$ of 
    0.92,
compared to 
    0.56
for the \gls{nltt}-based SVR, and
    0.75
for the linear regression against Sackin's index. There was little variation
about the mean for different tree and epidemic sizes. No classifier could
accurately identify the $m$ parameter in any epidemic scenario, with average
$R^2$ values of 
  0.12 for \gls{kSVR},
  0.01 for the \gls{nltt}, and
  0.06
for Sackin's index. Again, there was little variation in accuracy between
epidemic scenarios, although the accuracy of the \gls{kSVR} was slightly higher
on 1000-tip trees 
    (average $R^2$ 
     0.01,
     0.11,
     0.32
     for 100, 500, and 1000 tips respectively).

The accuracy of classifiers $I$ varied significantly with the number of tips in
the tree. For 100-tip trees, the average $R^2$ values were
  0.7,
  0.55, and
  0.02
for the tree kernel, \gls{nltt}, and Sackin's index respectively. For 500-tip
trees, the values increased to
  0.93,
  0.83, and
  0.07.
Finally, the performance of classifiers for $N$ depended heavily on the
epidemic scenario. The $R^2$ of the \gls{kSVR} classifier ranged from
  0.08
for the smallest epidemic and smallest sample size, to
  0.82
for the largest. Likewise, $R^2$ for the \gls{nltt}-based SVR ranged from 
  0.01
to
  0.54.
Sackin's index did not accurately classify $N$ in any scenario, with an average
$R^2$ of
  0.03
and little variation between scenarios.

      simulated transmission trees over networks with three different values of
      the parameter being tested. Vertical lines are empirical 95\% confidence
      intervals based on 1000 two-fold cross-validations.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Marginal parameter estimates with grid search}



The accuracy of grid search estimates largely paralleled that of the \gls{kSVR}
classifiers. \Cref{fig:gridest} shows point estimates and 95\% highest density
intervals for each of the \gls{BA} parameters, for one replicate experiment
with 500-tip trees. Plots showing the point estimates for all replicates can be
found in \cref{fig:gridptalpha,fig:gridptI,fig:gridptm,fig:gridptN}. For all
parameters except $m$, the error of point estimates was negatively correlated
with the number of sampled tips in the tree (for
\gls{alpha}, \gls{I}, and \gls{N} respectively: Spearman's $\rho$ = 
    \ensuremath{-0.22},
    \ensuremath{-0.51},
    \ensuremath{-0.16};
$p$-values
    $4\!\times\!10^{-4}$,
    ${<}10^{-5}$,
    $0.01$).
The highest density intervals obtained for all parameters were extremely wide,
occupying $>$75\% of the grid in all cases (\cref{fig:gridest}).

The \gls{alpha} parameter was the most accurately estimated, with point
estimates having an average deviation of 
    0.14
from the true value, on a grid from 0 to 2. The error of point estimates varied
significantly between true values of \gls{alpha}
    (one-way \gls{ANOVA}, $p$ ${<}10^{-5}$). In
particular, errors were lower for the values \gls{alpha} = 1.0 and 1.25 than
for the other values
    (average errors 
    0.03
    for \gls{alpha} = 1.0 or 1.5 vs.
    0.17
    for \gls{alpha} $\neq$ 1.0 or 1.5),
and this difference was significant
    (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, $p {<}10^{-5}$,
     \cref{fig:gridptalpha}).
These two values exhibited different qualitative behaviour than the other
values in terms of the distribution of kernel scores along the grid
(\cref{fig:gridalpha}). In particular, there was a pronounced peak in scores
around the true value, in contrast to the other values where the scores were
flat around the true value. The effect was most obvious for the value
\gls{alpha} = 1.25.

The average absolute error of the point estimates for \gls{I} was 
    310 individuals,
on a grid of 500 to 5000, and these errors differed between true values of
\gls{I}
    (one-way \gls{ANOVA}, $p =0.001$).
The errors for $2000 \leq I \leq 3000$ were higher than those for the other
values
    (average errors
     430
     for $2000 \leq I \leq 3000$ vs.
     250
     for $I < 2000$ or $I > 3000$),
and this difference was significant
    (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, $p =6\!\times\!10^{-4}$,
     \cref{fig:gridptI}).
Kernel score distributions for all test values exhibited a similar rounded
shape (\cref{fig:gridI}). 

The average error for \gls{m} was
    1.31 edges per vertex,
on a grid from 1 to 6. The error varied significantly between the true values
of \gls{m} 
    (one-way \gls{ANOVA}, $p {<}10^{-5}$).
Errors for the value \gls{m} = 1 were lower than the other values
    (average errors
    0.1
    for $m = 1$ vs.
    1.55
    for $m > 1$),
and this difference was significant
    (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, $p {<}10^{-5}$,
     \cref{fig:gridptm}).
The value $m = 1$ causes the network to take on a distinct shape relative to
higher \gls{m} values, namely a tree (\ie there are no cycles, see
\cref{subsec:treeshape}). The kernel score distribution had a peak at $m = 1$
when this was the true value, and a valley at $m = 1$ when the true value of
$m$ was greater that 1 (\cref{fig:gridm}).

The average error for \gls{N} was 
    2419 individuals,
on a grid from 1000 to 15000, and was varied significantly with the true value
of \gls{N}
    (one-way \gls{ANOVA}, $p {<}10^{-5}$).
The errors were lower for $N \leq 3000$
    (average errors
     740
     for $N \leq 3000$ vs.
     2979
     for $N > 3000$),
and this difference was significant
    (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, $p {<}10^{-5}$,
     \cref{fig:gridptN}).
The kernel score distribution had a peak at $N = 1000$ when this was the true
value, and a valley there otherwise (\cref{fig:gridN}). Except for this valley,
the distributions were flat for $N > 3000$.

      others fixed. For a subset of the grid values ($x$-axis), test networks
      and trees were created and compared to each tree on the grid using the
      tree kernel. The kernel scores along the grid were normalized to resemble
      a probability distribution, from which the mode and highest density
      interval were calculated. Shown values correspond to one replicate
      experiment, with trees of size 500.

\subsubsection*{Joint parameter estimates with kernel-assisted ABC}



\Cref{fig:abcptm2} shows \gls{MAP} point estimates of the BA model parameters
obtained with kernel-assisted ABC on simulated data. The estimates shown correspond only
to the simulations where the $m$ parameter was set to 2, however the results
for $m = 3$ and $m = 4$ were similar (\cref{fig:abcptm3,fig:abcptm4}). Average
boundaries of 95\% HPD intervals are given in \cref{tab:abchpd}.

The accuracy of the parameter estimates obtained with kernel-assisted ABC
paralleled the results from the \gls{kSVR} classifier. Of the four parameters,
$\alpha$ was the most accurately estimated, with point estimates having a
median [IQR] absolute error of 
    0.08 
    [0.05 - 
    0.17].
The errors when the true value of $\alpha$ was zero were significantly greater
than those for the other values 
    (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, $p$ = $0.0078$).
Errors in estimating $\alpha$ also varied with the true value of $m$ just at
the threshold of statistical significance
    (one-way ANOVA, $p 
    =0.05$),
but did not vary across the true value of $I$ (one-way ANOVA). Estimates for
$I$ were relatively accurate, with point estimate errors of
    395 
    [207 - 
    683] individuals.
These errors were significantly higher when the true value of $\alpha$ was
at least 1
    (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, $p$ = $0.0077$)
and when the true value of $I$ was 2000 ($p < 10^{-5}$). The true value of $m$
did not affect the estimates of $I$ (one-way ANOVA).

The $m$ parameter was estimated correctly in only
    27 \%
of simulations, barely better than random guessing. The true values of the
other parameters did not significantly affect the estimates of $m$ (both
one-way ANOVA). Finally, the total number of nodes $N$ was consistently
over-estimated by about a factor of two
    (error 5987 
    [2060 - 
     7999] individuals).
No parameters influenced the accuracy of the $N$ estimates (all one-way ANOVA).

      estimated with kernel-assisted ABC without training.
  }
  \label{tab:abchpd}
\end{table*}



The dispersion of the ABC approximation to the posterior also varied between
the parameters, with narrower HPD intervals for the parameters with more
accurate point estimates (\cref{tab:abchpd}). \Cref{fig:abcex} shows
the distributions for one simulation. Equivalent plots for one replicate
simulation with each studied parameter combination can be found in
\cref{fig:0.0-1000-2-5000-0,fig:0.5-1000-2-5000-0,fig:1.0-1000-2-5000-0,fig:1.5-1000-2-5000-0,fig:0.0-2000-2-5000-0,fig:0.5-2000-2-5000-0,fig:1.0-2000-2-5000-0,fig:1.5-2000-2-5000-0,fig:0.0-1000-3-5000-0,fig:0.5-1000-3-5000-0,fig:1.0-1000-3-5000-0,fig:1.5-1000-3-5000-0,fig:0.0-2000-3-5000-0,fig:0.5-2000-3-5000-0,fig:1.0-2000-3-5000-0,fig:1.5-2000-3-5000-0,fig:0.0-1000-4-5000-0,fig:0.5-1000-4-5000-0,fig:1.0-1000-4-5000-0,fig:1.5-1000-4-5000-0,fig:0.0-2000-4-5000-0,fig:0.5-2000-4-5000-0,fig:1.0-2000-4-5000-0,fig:1.5-2000-4-5000-0}. HPD intervals around $\alpha$ and $I$ were often narrow
relative to the region of nonzero prior density, whereas the intervals for $m$
and $N$ were more widely dispersed.

To test the effect of model misspecification, we simulated one network where
the nodes exhibited heterogeneous preferential attachment power (half 0.5, the
other half 1.5), with $m$ = 2, $N$ = 5000, and $I$ = 1000. The MAP [95\%
HPD] estimates for each parameter were: 
$\alpha$, 
  1.1 
  [0.6 -
   1.15];
$I$,
  1133 
  [662 -
   4455];
$m$,
  3 
  [1 -
   5];
$N$,
  12655 
  [3733-
   14933].
The approximate posterior distributions for this simulation are shown in
\cref{fig:mixed}. To test the effect of sampling bias, we sampled one
transmission tree in a peer-driven fashion, where the probability to sample a
node was twice as high if one of its peers had already been sampled. The
parameters for this experiment were $N$ = 5000, $m$ = 2, $\alpha$ = 0.5, and
$I$ = 2000. The estimated values were
$\alpha$, 
  0.37 
  [0.01 -
   0.63];
$I$,
  2415 
  [1419 -
   3811];
$m$,
  3 
  [2 -
   5];
$N$,
  8973 
  [2881 -
   14788].
The approximate posterior distributions are shown in \cref{fig:peerdriven}. Both
of these results were in line with estimates obtained on other simulated
datasets (\cref{tab:abchpd}), although the estimate of peer-driven sampling for
$\alpha$ was somewhat lower than typical.

\subsection{Application to HIV data}



We applied kernel-assisted ABC to five published HIV datasets (\cref{tab:data}),
and found substantial heterogeneity among the parameter estimates
(\cref{fig:abchpd,fig:abchpdm2}). Plots of the marginal posterior distributions
for each dataset are shown in
\cref{fig:cuevas,fig:li,fig:niculescu,fig:novitsky,fig:wang}.
Two of the datasets (\textcite{niculescu2015recent, wang2015targeting}) had
estimated $\alpha$ values near unity for the prior allowing $m = 1$ (\gls{MAP}
estimates [95\% \gls{HPD}] 
  1.04 
  [0.04 - 
   1.25]
and
  0.82 
  [0.01 -
   1.03] respectively).
The MAP estimates did not change appreciably when $m = 1$ was disallowed by the
prior, although the credible interval of the \textcite{niculescu2015recent}
data was narrower
  (0.04 - 
   1.25).
When $m = 1$ was permitted, the \textcite{li2015hiv, cuevas2009hiv} both had
low estimated $\alpha$ values
  (0.3 
  [0 - 
  0.75]
and
  0.3 
  [0.01 -
   0.79]). 
However, the MAP estimates increased when $m = 1$ was not permitted, although
the HPD intervals remained roughly the same
  (0.78 
  [0.02 - 
  0.93]
and
  0.58 
  [0.08 -
   0.95]).
The \textcite{novitsky2014impact} data had a fairly low estimated $\alpha$
for both priors on $m$
  (0.29 for $m \geq 1$;
   0.23 for $m \geq 2$).
However, the confidence interval was much wider when $m = 1$ was allowed
  ([0.03 -
    1.6] for $m \geq 1$ vs.
   [0 -
    0.73] for $m \geq 2$).

For all the datasets except \citeauthor{novitsky2014impact}, estimated values
of $I$ were below 2000 when $m = 1$ was allowed, with relatively narrow HPD
intervals compared to the nonzero prior density region
  (\citeauthor{cuevas2009hiv}, 497 
  [287 -
   2430];
   \citeauthor{niculescu2015recent}, 307
  [138 - 
   2822];
  \citeauthor{li2015hiv}, 1217 
  [383 -
   2897];
   \citeauthor{wang2015targeting}, 621
  [182 - 
   2139]).
The \citeauthor{novitsky2014impact} data was the outlier, with a very high
estimated $I$, and HPD interval spanning almost the entire prior region
  (7642 
  [187 -
   8836]).
The $I$ estimates and HPD intervals were generally robust to the choice of
prior on $m$, with slightly narrower HPD intervals (compare
\cref{fig:abchpd,fig:abchpdm2}).

The MAP estimate of $m$ was equal to 1 for all but the
\citeauthor{novitsky2014impact} data, when this value was allowed. However, the
upper bound of the HPD interval was different for each dataset
  (\citeauthor{niculescu2015recent}, 5;
   \citeauthor{wang2015targeting}, 4;
   \citeauthor{li2015hiv}, 1;
   \citeauthor{cuevas2009hiv}, 2).
When $m = 1$ was disallowed, the MAP for all datasets was either 2 or 3, with
HPD intervals spanning the entire prior region. The estimates for the total
number of nodes $N$ were largely uninformative for all samples, with almost all
MAP estimates greater than 7500 and HPD intervals spanning almost the entire
nonzero prior density region. The only exception was the \citeauthor{li2015hiv}
data, for which the MAP estimate was lower 
  (7428)
when $m = 1$ was allowed.

To make our analyses comparable to the existing network literature, we
estimated values of the power law exponent $\gamma$ for each of the datasets 
investigated. The results are summarized in \cref{tab:gamma}. All of the
estimated exponents were in the range $2 \leq \gamma \leq 2.5$, which is on the
lower end of the range $2 \leq \gamma \leq 4$ reported in the literature.
