# Programs

This folder contains all the software written for my thesis.

## netabc

An R package containing a bunch of mostly utility type functions. Mainly this
is just so I could write short rules for doing the experiments and have all the
complexity wrapped up in the package, and also to bring in the other libraries
I'm using. It probably wouldn't be a useful package for its own sake.

## netsim

This is the main software component of this project. It contains C source code
for several binaries, described in more details in its own README.

## pcbr

This is an old version of the MMPP code I wrote for my rotation project. It's
mostly been incorporated into netsim and will probably be removed in the
future.
