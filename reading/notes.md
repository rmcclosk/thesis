# Tree Kernel

**[@moschitti2006making]**

* Fast algorithm for computing the tree kernel by ordering nodes by production
rule (Table 1).

# Kernel-ABC

**[@poon2015phylodynamic]**

* Kernel-ABC was able to distinguish differing contact rates in a compartmental
model much more effectively than Sackin's index (Figure 1).

## Contact Networks

**[@leventhal2012inferring]**

* Compare Sackin's index of trees generated from Erdős–Rényi (ER) networks,
Barabási–Albert (BA) networks, Watts-Strogatz (WS) networks, and full graphs
(FG).
* Sackin's index has a local maximum when the transmissibility is set to the
critical value between the epidemic dying out and taking off (Figure 1). This
means Sackin's index is not useful in determining whether an epidemic will
emerge or not - like Figure 1A in [@poon2015phylodynamic].
* "it is not always possible to distinguish between the BA and WS models when
considering the Sackin index as a measure of tree topology"
* When a small number of tips (5%) are sampled from a larger tree, the network
types become indistinguishable by Sackin's index (Figure 4).
* Sampling only alive/infectious individuals, as opposed to including
dead/removed samples in the tree, increases the difference in Sackin's index
between the network types (Figure 6).
* Also examined a real HIV tree, but were only able to say that the contact
structure was non-random.
